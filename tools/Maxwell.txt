This is Maxwell's daemon, an application that reads MySQL binlogs and writes row updates to Kafka as JSON. 
Maxwell has a low operational bar and produces a consistent, easy to ingest stream of updates. It allows you 
to easily "bolt on" some of the benefits of stream processing systems without going through your entire code 
base to add (unreliable) instrumentation points. Common use cases include ETL, cache building/expiring, 
metrics collection, search indexing and inter-service communication.
