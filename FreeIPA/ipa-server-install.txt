Do you want to configure integrated DNS (BIND)? [no]: yes

Enter the fully qualified domain name of the computer
on which you're setting up server software. Using the form
<hostname>.<domainname>
Example: master.example.com.


Server host name [IPA01]: ipamaster.csdn.net                        

Warning: skipping DNS resolution of host ipamaster.csdn.net

Warning: hostname ipamaster.csdn.net does not match system hostname IPA01.
System hostname will be updated during the installation process
to prevent service failures.

The domain name has been determined based on the host name.

Please confirm the domain name [csdn.net]: 

The kerberos protocol requires a Realm name to be defined.
This is typically the domain name converted to uppercase.

Please provide a realm name [CSDN.NET]: 
Certain directory server operations require an administrative user.
This user is referred to as the Directory Manager and has full access
to the Directory for system management tasks and will be added to the
instance of directory server created for IPA.
The password must be at least 8 characters long.

Directory Manager password: 
Password (confirm): 

The IPA server requires an administrative user, named 'admin'.
This user is a regular system account used for IPA server administration.

IPA admin password: 
Password (confirm):

Do you want to configure DNS forwarders? [yes]: 
Enter an IP address for a DNS forwarder, or press Enter to skip: 
No DNS forwarders configured
Do you want to configure the reverse zone? [yes]: 
Please specify the reverse zone name [25.168.192.in-addr.arpa.]:

==============================================================================
Setup complete

Next steps:
	1. You must make sure these network ports are open:
		TCP Ports:
		  * 80, 443: HTTP/HTTPS
		  * 389, 636: LDAP/LDAPS
		  * 88, 464: kerberos
		  * 53: bind
		UDP Ports:
		  * 88, 464: kerberos
		  * 53: bind
		  * 123: ntp

	2. You can now obtain a kerberos ticket using the command: 'kinit admin'
	   This ticket will allow you to use the IPA tools (e.g., ipa user-add)
	   and the web user interface.

Be sure to back up the CA certificates stored in /root/cacert.p12
These files are required to create replicas. The password for these
files is the Directory Manager password
