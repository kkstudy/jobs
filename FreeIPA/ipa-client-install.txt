DNS discovery failed to determine your DNS domain
Provide the domain name of your IPA server (ex: example.com): csdn.net
Provide your IPA server name (ex: ipa.example.com): ipamaster.csdn.net
The failure to use DNS to find your IPA server indicates that your resolv.conf file is not properly configured.
Autodiscovery of servers for failover cannot work with this configuration.
If you proceed with the installation, services will be configured to always access the discovered server for all operations and will not fail over to other servers in case of failure.
Proceed with fixed values and no DNS discovery? [no]: yes
Client hostname: client01.csdn.net
