Success! Kerberos is now running. You can enable Kerberos in a Cloudera Manager
cluster from the drop-down menu for that cluster on the CM home page. It will
ask you to confirm that this script performed the following steps:

    * set up a working KDC.
    * checked that the KDC allows renewable tickets.
    * installed the client libraries.
    * created a proper account for Cloudera Manager.

Then, it will prompt you for the following details (accept defaults if not
specified here):

    KDC Type:                MIT KDC
    KDC Server Host:         quickstart.cloudera
    Kerberos Security Realm: CLOUDERA

Later, it will prompt you for KDC account manager credentials:

    Username: cloudera-scm/admin (@ CLOUDERA)
    Password: cloudera
